DESCRIPTION:Inverted search is a technique used in information retrieval systems, 
            databases, and search engines to efficiently find occurrences of words
            or terms in a collection of files or documents. It relies on an inverted 
            index, which is a data structure that maps words to the files or locations
            where they appear.
		 
		 This project is highly useful in scenarios that involve managing large sets of text data, such as:

          Libraries and Digital Archives:
		  Helps in managing large volumes of text-based content, allowing users to search for specific terms efficiently.
          Search Engines:
		  Powers the search feature of search engines, where users search for specific words across millions of documents.
          Data Analysis and Text Mining: 
		  Used in processing textual data from various sources to extract insights.

1. Creating an Inverted Index
To perform an inverted search, we first build an inverted index, which consists of:

A word dictionary (unique words extracted from files/documents).
A list of files where each word appears.
The frequency of the word in each file.

input: A collection of text files containing words.
Process: The system reads each file, indexes the words, and counts their occurrences.
Output: A display of each wordâ€™s occurrences across files in the format of a word index, showing how many times the word appears in each file and listing the file names along with the word count.
